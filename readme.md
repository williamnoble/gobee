# GoBee is a restAPI written in Go for managing a bee colony

This is a work in progress. 

I wanted to write a restAPI with the Go standard library to manage a Bee Colony through a
restAPI. This will include creating the colony, managing individual hives and then sending off the bees to work.

It should be clarified, these are bees in code not bees with chips attached! Also, my purpose is simply to help educsate people
who want to learn go. 

I'd also love to turn this in to a youtube series for two reasons. 
* One to help my public speaking 
* To help aspiring Go developers. 

Sometimes I think the projects we build, whilst simplified real world
examples, can be a little dull. I wanted to inject a little humour and rather than building another moviedatabase or todo
list, I will build a restAPI for managing bees!

It also gives me an excuse to demonstate a use of enums outside of logging (in modelling bee Caste) and eventually the use of go routines in controlling bee behavour. 

This is a long term project so it will be some weeks before I can update!
